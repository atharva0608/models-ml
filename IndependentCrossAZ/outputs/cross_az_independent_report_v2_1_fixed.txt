MODEL 3: INDEPENDENT CROSS-AZ CAPACITY ANALYZER v2.1 (FIXED)
================================================================================

VERSION HISTORY:
  v2.0: Initial independent version (FLAWED - stability metrics inflated scores)
  v2.1: FIXED CALIBRATION - stability metrics now correctly reduce risk

PRODUCTION READINESS: YES

FIX APPLIED:
  ✓ Inverted stability metrics (coherence, synchronization)
  ✓ High volatility coherence → LOW risk (was: HIGH risk)
  ✓ High price synchronization → LOW risk (was: HIGH risk)
  ✓ Reweighted: stress/compression get higher weight (70% vs 50%)
  ✓ Adjusted thresholds: Low <20 (was <30), Moderate 20-40 (was 30-50)

INDEPENDENCE:
  ✓ Does NOT depend on Model 1 (price predictions)
  ✓ Does NOT depend on Model 3.1 (anomaly risk scores)
  ✓ Analyzes raw spot price data across all AZs
  ✓ Produces independent regional capacity risk scores
  ✓ Can validate other models OR stand alone

METHODOLOGY:
  Analyzes: All 3 AZs in ap-south-1
  Instance Type: c5.large
  AZs: aps1-az1, aps1-az2, aps1-az3

CROSS-AZ FEATURES (FIXED FORMULA):
  1. Synchronized Stress (35% weight) - INCREASED
     - % of AZs simultaneously stressed

  2. Compression Agreement (25% weight) - INCREASED
     - % of AZs showing discount compression

  3. Absolute Compression (15% weight) - INCREASED
     - Average compression magnitude

  4. Volatility INSTABILITY (10% weight) - FIXED
     - INVERTED: 100 - coherence (low coherence = HIGH risk)

  5. Price DIVERGENCE (10% weight) - FIXED
     - INVERTED: 100 - synchronization (low sync = HIGH risk)

  6. Deviation Coherence (5% weight) - DECREASED
     - Multiple AZs deviating from baseline

RISK SCORE FORMULA (v2.1 - FIXED):
  regional_risk = (
      sync_stress * 0.35 +           # Direct stress (↑ from 0.25)
      compression_agree * 0.25 +     # Compression (↑ from 0.20)
      absolute_compression * 0.15 +  # Magnitude (↑ from 0.10)
      volatility_INSTABILITY * 0.10 + # FIXED: 100 - coherence
      price_DIVERGENCE * 0.10 +       # FIXED: 100 - sync
      deviation_cohere * 0.05         # Reduced from 0.15
  ) + event_boost (up to +10)

OLD FORMULA (v2.0 - WRONG):
  # This incorrectly treated stability as risk!
  regional_risk = sync_stress*0.25 + compression*0.20 + 
                  volatility_coherence*0.15 + price_sync*0.15 + ...
                  ^^^ HIGH coherence added to risk (WRONG!)

PERFORMANCE (v2.1):
  Mean Regional Risk: 10.4/100
  Median: 8.4/100
  Max: 35.2/100
  P95: 18.8/100

RISK DISTRIBUTION (v2.1):
  Low (<20): 265 days (97.1%)
  Moderate (20-40): 8 days
  High (40-60): 0 days
  Critical (>60): 0 days

REGIONAL PATTERNS:
  Avg Synchronized Stress: 0.6%
  Avg Compression Agreement: 0.0%
  Avg Volatility Coherence: 94.2%
  Avg Price Synchronization: 69.8%
  Avg Stressed AZs: 0.02 / 3

BASELINE (per AZ, from 2023-24):
  aps1-az1: 54.9% ± 6.3% (P5=43.5%, P95=65.5%)
  aps1-az2: 54.9% ± 8.0% (P5=40.0%, P95=65.8%)
  aps1-az3: 56.8% ± 5.7% (P5=48.0%, P95=68.0%)

KEY INSIGHTS (v2.1):
  • Low sync stress + low compression = Safe for Spot ✅
  • High coherence + high sync = Stability (LOW risk) ✅
  • High sync stress = Regional capacity crisis ⚠️
  • High compression agreement = Regional tightening ⚠️
  • Low coherence = AZ instability (moderate risk) ⚠️
  • Low sync = AZ divergence (investigate) 🔍

PRODUCTION USE:
  Standalone: Use regional_risk as primary signal
  Ensemble: Combine with Model 1 & 3.1 for robustness
  Validation: Filter false positives from other models

  Decision Thresholds (v2.1):
    < 20: USE_SPOT (low regional risk)
    20-40: USE_SPOT_WITH_MONITORING (moderate)
    40-60: CONSIDER_ON_DEMAND (high regional risk)
    > 60: MIGRATE_TO_ON_DEMAND (critical regional stress)

COMPARISON vs v2.0:
  v2.0 Mean Risk: 36.6/100 (inflated by stability metrics)
  v2.1 Mean Risk: 10.4/100 (correctly calibrated)

  Expected v2.1 behavior for stable pool:
    - Mean risk: 10-20/100 (LOW - reflecting actual stability)
    - High-risk days: <5% (only genuine regional events)
    - Discrimination: Clear separation between stable/stressed periods
